Sure! Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how the regex ^([1-9]|[1-9][0-9]|1[0-9]{2}|2[0-4][0-9]|25[0-5])(\.([0-9]|[1-9][0-9]|1[0-9]{2}|2[0-4][0-9]|25[0-5])){2}\.(25[0-4]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)$ works:

^ - This symbol indicates the start of the string. The regex will only match if the IP address is at the beginning of the string.

( - This symbol starts a capturing group. The contents of this group will be captured and can be referenced later in the regex.

[1-9] - This character set matches any digit between 1 and 9. This is used to match the first digit of an octet that is between 1 and 9.

| - This symbol indicates an OR operation. The regex will match if either the expression before or after this symbol matches.

[1-9][0-9] - This expression matches any two-digit number that starts with a digit between 1 and 9 and ends with any digit between 0 and 9.

| - Another OR operation.

1[0-9]{2} - This expression matches any three-digit number that starts with a 1 and is followed by any two digits between 0 and 9.

| - Another OR operation.

2[0-4][0-9] - This expression matches any three-digit number that starts with a 2, is followed by a digit between 0 and 4, and ends with any digit between 0 and 9.

| - Another OR operation.

25[0-5] - This expression matches any three-digit number that starts with a 25 and ends with a digit between 0 and 5.

) - This symbol ends the capturing group that started in step 2.

( - This symbol starts another capturing group.

\. - This expression matches a literal dot character. The dot is used to separate octets in an IP address.

( - This symbol starts another capturing group.

[0-9] - This character set matches any digit between 0 and 9. This is used to match the first digit of an octet that is between 0 and 9.

| - Another OR operation.

[1-9][0-9] - This expression matches any two-digit number that starts with a digit between 1 and 9 and ends with any digit between 0 and 9.

| - Another OR operation.

1[0-9]{2} - This expression matches any three-digit number that starts with a 1 and is followed by any two digits between 0 and 9.

| - Another OR operation.

2[0-4][0-9] - This expression matches any three-digit number that starts with a 2, is followed by a digit between 0 and 4, and ends with any digit between 0 and 9.

| - Another OR operation.

25[0-5] - This expression matches any three-digit number that starts with a 25 and ends with a digit between 0 and 5.

) - This symbol ends the capturing group that started in step 15.

{2} - This quantifier indicates that the preceding group should be matched exactly two times. In this case, it means that the regex will match exactly two octets separated by dots after the first octet.

\. - Another literal dot character to separate octets.

(25[0-4]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?) - This expression is similar to the previous expressions for matching octets, but it adds an additional check to ensure that the last octet is not equal to 255.

$ - This symbol indicates the end of the string. The regex will only match if the IP address is at the end of the string.

I hope this explanation helps you understand how this regex works to validate IP addresses according to your
